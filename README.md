<h1 align = "center"> Hello, Yoma here 👋 💻 </h1>
<h3 align="center"> I’m an AI & Machine Learning Engineer with hands-on experience building and optimising LLM-powered applications, machine learning models, and end-to-end MLOps workflows. I’m passionate about transforming real-world problems into scalable AI solutions. I work extensively on LLM customisation and optimisation, including continued pre-training, post-training techniques (LoRA/QLoRA), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, and advanced prompt engineering. I enjoy improving model quality, reducing inference latency, optimising GPU usage, and deploying scalable AI services in real-world environments.

My technical toolkit includes Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, HuggingFace, FastAPI, Docker, GitHub Actions, Weights & Biases , Runpod, Postgres, and AWS, with experience in quantization, GPU optimisation, and containerised deployments.

I’m deeply interested in Multimodal AI, MLOps, AI infrastructure, and AI for Cybersecurity, and I love working at the intersection of research, engineering, and real-world problem-solving. If you’d like to connect about LLMs in general (pre and post-training), RAG, MLOps, or cybersecurity-driven AI, feel free to reach out. I’m always open to meaningful conversations and opportunities</h3>
